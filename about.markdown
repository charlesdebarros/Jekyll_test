Hello and welcome.

I'm Charles. I am a Junior Data Analyst and [BCS](https://www.bcs.org/) (The Chartered Institute for IT) member, passionate about the Environmental, Educational, and Scientific areas. I am always searching for new angles to look at things and fresh approaches to deal with challenges.

I am organised, analytical, and have a logical mind, attentive to details and patterns. I am an experienced Ruby on Rails web developer with experience in SQL/PostgreSQL databases, Python and JavaScript. I enjoy experimenting with new technologies and strive to learn something new daily.

I am highly motivated, like to take the initiative, and my thirst for learning new things is my daily motivation. I would relish the opportunity to work with Data Analysis and expand my skills in the Data Analytics field. I am always looking for great mentors and outstanding managers.

## Skills:

- Problem-solving
- Analytical mind 
- Strategic Planning and Data-based decisions
- Business Intelligence - Power BI, Tableau
- Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, spreadsheets
- Power Query, Power Pivot, Pivot Tables
- Python
- Python libraries - Pandas, NumPy

- JavaScript and jQuery
- Bootstrap and Tailwind
- Git, Heroku, Jira
- WordPress, Joomla!
- SQL, MySQL, PostgreSQL
- Communication and Public Speaking
- Portuguese-br and English native level.
- French beginners level.

I am looking to obtain a Junior Data Analyst role, preferably remote or hybrid, where I can expand my current knowledge, learn new skills, and be exposed to good practices. 

I’m a huge fan of computer Open-Source applications, such as Linux OS (Fedora and Ubuntu). I am a puzzles, challenges, and problem-solving activities enthusiast. I have a very active mind always looking for new things to learn on edX, Udemy, and Coursera.

I have a very communicative nature. I once presented a talk at the NADDI 2019 conference in Ottawa, Canada, with a colleague representing the CLOSER project from UCL – University College London. I like languages, having a native level in both Brazilian Portuguese and English. I can find my way around in French. I am also an adventurous baker.
